    "A family friend (Lucy) was tired of working for a large marketing firm in Manhattan and since she was already working 80 hour weeks, she decided that she would partner with her parents and siblings to open a dry cleaning business in the the New York Borough of Brooklyn, where most of her family lived. \n",

    "The parents once had a dry cleaning business in Merida Spain, so they would be the business experts, while Lucy and her siblings would provide the labor. One of her sisters had a business background, so she would provide the business prowness.\n",

    "The issue on hand was to find a location within Brooklyn that would be the best location for their new business. The location needed to serve a neighborhood that did not have a high density of dry cleaners already located within a half mile.\n",
